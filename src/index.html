 <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>

      <p>My name is Jannes I am 26 years old and currently live in Purmerend. As a young boy I was always busy with computers, started gaming and fixing / repairing computers a lot in my earlier years, I discovered at a young age that PC and IT in general fascinate me. </p>
      <p>After trying multiple different things throughout my life, for example: becoming a social worker, I realized I had to follow my true ambitions: to become a programmer. To do this was going to be a tough challenge, one does not simply become one overnight, one does through working hard and to keep learning. </p>  
      <p>I signed up for the Codaisseur Full Stack Bootcamp this year to fulfil my dream, after 11 intensive weeks of building awesome webbaps and completing assessments I managed to overcome obstacles and succeed along side my peers. I know certain technologies you can see listed below.</p> 
      <p>Although I can call myself a developer now,there still much to learn. My mission is continuous learning, I keep learning, I keep growing, a little bit better each day is still a little bit!</p>
